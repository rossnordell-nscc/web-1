        <p> I am currently enrolled in <em>Graphic Design</em> at <em>NSCC's Ivany Campus</em>. I finally feel like I am doing what I am meant to be doing but it wasn't a straightforward journey to get here. I have been in Halifax for about 6 years and for most of that time I felt like I was just floating through my life. On my birthday two years ago I took a moment to reflect on what was important to me and I realized a lot of my favourite pastimes were creative. This lead me to <em>NSCC's</em> website which lead me to their <em>AMCA</em> program. The class that stood out the most that year was <em>Graphic Design</em> so I put a portfolio together and applied... now here I am!</p>
